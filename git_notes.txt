Pull requests are how you merge branches on github

Github is a hub of .gits/directories

you can push and pull commits to and from .git/ directories

you can also clone .git/ directories to new computer repositories
master branch is label that git creates for us when we initialize a repository

HEAD is another label that git creats for us when we create our first commit

HEAD is *note* a branch

# creates a new branch (lable) called git-notes
git branch git-notes

#shows us which branch is active
git branch
